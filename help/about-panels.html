<h2>Drupal Panels</h2>
<p>Panels, at it's core, helps you to arrange your sites content. It is functionally similar to the template system in Drupal Core, but more flexible, and comes with a user interface, allowing for a visual way of structuring your site. It's important to note that Panels for most of it's operation requires the Page manager module, distributed with Ctools. There are also various ways that Panels and Display suite can be combined to improve the site-administrators experience.</p><!-- @todo Insert links to Ctools/Page manager modules/docs -->
<p>Some typical tasks that Panels makes much easier are
<ul>
  <li>Showing more than one View on a page, or a node together with a View.</li>
  <li>Displaying a single field more than once, for example at the both the top and bottom of a page.</li>
  <li>Re-arranging the node-edit form, hiding certain form elements, or moving the 'Save' button to the top of the for.</li>
  <li>Better separation between display of content and listing of content. Views and Panels integrate really well, allowing a single View to be resused in many places.</li>
  <li>And of course, many more things. Panels is a flexbile system, not a one-off solution.</li>
</ul>
