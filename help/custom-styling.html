<h2>Controlling the markup of Panel panes</h2>
There's a panel-panes.tpl.php file in the panels/templates directory. If you copy this file to your own themes templates directory, you will be able to control the markup of all your Panel panes.

<h2>Controlling the CSS of Panel panes</h2>
On each panel pane you add, you can also change "CSS Settings", which allows you to add CSS classes and ID's to individual content panes.
