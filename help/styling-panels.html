<h2>Styling your panel</h2>
<p>Once you have content flowing into a page, styling it is just back to CSS work. For example in Firebug you can see how panels creates the 2 column layout:-</p>
<p><div class="help-box"><img src="path:images/10000000000001D80000003A3C72F0CD.png"></img></div><div class="help-box"><img src="path:images/10000000000002600000005BC76D29CE.png"></img></div>Panels generates the HTML and has some standard stylesheets (2 columns of 50% width). You can override this in your own stylesheets. Or, if it doesn't suit you &#x2013; you can create your own layout which we'll do next.</p>
