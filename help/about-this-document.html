</p><h2>Document developed by Olamalu Web Development</h2><p>We're a small web development company based in Oxfordshire, England. We work exclusively on Drupal for our websites. We'd like to see it as the defacto standard for small and medium sized business websites. Having programmed in Java and PHP for a while, we're always amazed at how flexibly and powerfully Drupal and modules like Panels are architected.</p><p>For the moment we'll keep an updated version of this guide on our website at http://www.olamalu.com/content/our-guide-drupal-panels until we can find the best way to make it generally available.</p><p></p><p><strong>Version control</strong></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>Version</p></td><td><p>Changes</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1.0</p></td><td><p>Initial document</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1.1</p></td><td><p>Added arguments as contexts and programming context arguments</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1.2</p></td><td><p>Added writing content types (simple)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1.3</p></td><td><p>Added panels plugin definitions and advanced use cases &#x2013; flexible form</p></td></tr></table></tbody><p></p><p>License</p><p>This document is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (or &quot;GPL&quot;).</p>
