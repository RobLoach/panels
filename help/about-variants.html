</p><h2>The Variant Sections</h2><p>Once created your templates will have one or more variants (named by you) and within each variant a number of tabs which allows you to continuously change and work on each one.</p><p><div class="help-box"><img src="path:images/10000000000000A900000137BBAE3E1C.png"></img></div></p><p>In our case we have a number of variants &#x2013; each one a bit different. The Gallery of photos is laid out differently from the Blog or Standard Page.</p><p></p><p>Within the Standard Page (which we are currently editing, and which is therefore not collapsed) we see:</p><ul><li>Summary &#x2013; not editable, just an overview of the panel</li><li>General &#x2013; the panel title, CSS code, disable blocks toggle</li><li>Selection rules &#x2013; conditions on which this variant is used versus others</li><li>Contexts &#x2013; data passed into and around the panel</li><li>Layout &#x2013; the visual structure of the page</li><li>Content &#x2013; the content within the layout.</li></ul><p>You select each one to navigate around the panel definition. Remember to click 'update' or 'update and save' to store your changes.</p><p></p><h2>Setting up the variant</h2><p>This is an iterative process as you move from tab to tab &#x2013; so your process/preference may be different. This is the process we find logical for us.</p><p>
