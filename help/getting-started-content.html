<h2>Structuring the site content</h2>
<p>We usually start a site by going to CCK. That's where you structure the content which is going to be stored on the website. After that (well iteratively) we go to Drupal's Taxonomy. That's where you create the inter-relationships between content on the site. With that in place and some test data we go to Views to create dynamic data and finally we make it over to Panels to lay it all out.</p>
<p>Site structure &#x2013; CCK &amp; Taxonomy.</p>
<p>We create 2 content types &#x2013; 'Standard Page' and 'Testimonial'. The standard page is used for most pages, the blog and articles. It contains multiple image fields and text area/fields. The testimonial contains a single image and single text area.</p>
<p>We then create 2 taxonomies &#x2013; 'Page Type' and 'Offering'. The first is used on standard pages to identify if it is a normal page, a blog page or an article (we need this to lay them out differently in Panels later). The second is used by the studio for things like 'Studio Photography' or 'PR Photography' or 'Makeovers'. We also need this to link testimonials for each offering to the main pages.</p>
<p>There's so much about CCK and taxonomy out there, we won't go over the specifics here.</p>
<p>Site structure &#x2013; Views</p>
<p>Our next step is to create a number of views to display the list of blog items, the list of articles and the testimonials. You could create one view with different 'displays' or multiple views. The most important thing is to ensure there is a way the view knows that a particular term in the 'Offering' taxonomy is selected (by being on a page which has that taxonomy). This is done via the 'argument'.</p>
